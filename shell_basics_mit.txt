# To update your account to use zsh, please run `chsh -s /bin/zsh`
# In Terminal: Click on + sign to open multiple terminals | can run both zsh and bash

# Write: May have write file but not write directory...
# Execute: Search / are you able to gain access : Must have execute permission on every folder Bin/User/Echo etc.

# The default interactive shell is now zsh.
# To update your account to use zsh, please run `chsh -s /bin/zsh`.
# For more details, please visit https://support.apple.com/kb/HT208050
# bash-3.2$

# /sys/net/ipv4_forward     | for setting up firewall
# CMD: # means run this as root
# gives example of going through sys files, and changing kernel values to light up LEDs of various keys like scroll lock
# open file: xdg-open
